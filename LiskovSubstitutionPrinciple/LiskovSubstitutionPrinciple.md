The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a principle of object-oriented programming that states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, it means that if you have a base class and multiple derived classes, you should be able to use any derived class object wherever the base class object is expected.

This principle exists so that you know how to inherit properly.
